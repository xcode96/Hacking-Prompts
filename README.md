👉 **`xcode96/Hacking-Prompts`**

This project is essentially a **collection of AI prompts**, mainly focused on:

* 🚨 **Jailbreak prompts**
* 🧠 Advanced system-role prompts
* 🛠 Prompt engineering techniques
* 🔓 Prompt security & bypass research (educational / research-focused)

### 1️⃣ Prompt Vault (Top Left)

**“Prompt Vault”** is the name of the interface.

Tagline:

> *Color-coded prompts. Minimalist design. Zero tracking.*

This suggests:

* Clean UI
* No analytics / tracking
* Likely static (HTML + JS)

---

### 2️⃣ Search Bar

🔍 **“Search prompts by name or description…”**

Allows you to:

* Search prompt files (`.md`)
* Filter by prompt name or purpose

---

### 3️⃣ Prompt Counter

> **Showing 146 of 292 prompts**

This means:

* Total prompts: **292**
* Currently filtered view: **146**
* The repo is **large and actively curated**

---

### 4️⃣ Prompt Cards (Main Content)

Each card represents a **Markdown prompt file**, for example:

| File Name     | Description      |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| `AGI.md`      | Jailbreak prompt |
| `Apex.md`     | Jailbreak prompt |
| `BOB.md`      | Jailbreak prompt |
| `CodeGPT6.md` | Jailbreak prompt |
| `Complex.md`  | Jailbreak prompt |

Each card shows:

* 📄 File name
* 🚨 Red warning text: **“This is a jailbreak prompt.”**
* 🔴 Tag: `Jailbreak`

➡️ This clearly labels **high-risk / restricted prompts**.
