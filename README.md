### 📌 What the Repository Is Likely About

Based on the name **“Hacking-Prompts”** and common usage of similar GitHub projects, it probably contains:

✅ A **collection of AI/ChatGPT prompt examples** for hacking-related topics or cybersecurity concepts
✔ prompts designed to guide AI into answering hacking, security,--oriented questions
✔ organized examples demonstrating how to craft effective developmental or red-teaming prompts

These kinds of repos often serve as **prompt libraries**—similar to prompt-collections or prompt-hacker repositories seen on GitHub topics like `prompt-injection`, `prompts`, or `ai-prompts`. ([GitHub][3])

### 📝 If You Need the README Text

Copying and pasting the *raw* contents of the README (once accessible) here is totally fine — I can then:

✔ Summarize it
✔ Explain each section
✔ Help rewrite it professionally
✔ Help improve or extend it

Just share the raw text itself.
